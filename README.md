# Diamond Price Prediction
My participation in the competition organized by ShAI in Kaggle, aimed at predicting diamond prices. I explored various models and leveraged pipelines to identify the one that delivers the best performance and highest score.

# Data: 
The model is trained and tested on the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diamond-price-prediction/data).This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. There are 10 features in the dataset including the target variable.
Some of the Features:
* Carat : is the diamond’s physical weight.
* Cut : Describe cut quality of the diamond. The values of this feature are Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal; the more precise the diamond is cut, the more captivating the diamond is to the eye.
* Color : Color of the Diamond. With D being the best and J the worst.
* Clarity : Diamond Clarity refers to the absence of the Inclusions and Blemishes.
* Dimensions:
    * X : Length of the Diamond in mm.
    * Y : Width of the Diamond in mm.
    * Z : Height of the Diamond in mm.
* Price : It's the target variable and it’s in US dollar
